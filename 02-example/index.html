    <p>Hello every one, my name is Albert and you are welcome to review my coupon system final project. I worked very hard on it and I will appreciate any comment you'll have to say abut it. This project is a REST project witch is a protocol for managing remote resources between server and server and client and server. this is based on Http communication using URL and a verb.</p>
    <p>This is the first Html Project that I pushed to "Github"</p>
